# Contributing to the People's Roadmap 2018

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the People's Roadmap 2018 :tada:! 

The People's Roadmap is both a visioning document to help guide NYCâ€™s digital future as well as a framework for other organizations to develop community-sourced policy documents in their communities.

This document is a set of guidelines for contributing to the People's Roadmap 2018 on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

## How to submit changes
