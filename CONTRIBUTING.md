# Contributing to the People's Roadmap 2018

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the People's Roadmap 2018 :tada:! 

The People's Roadmap is both a visioning document to help guide NYC’s digital future as well as a framework for other organizations to develop community-sourced policy documents in their communities.

This document is a set of guidelines for contributing to the People's Roadmap 2018 on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

* [Participation guidelines](#participation-guidelines)
* [What we're working on](#what-were-working-on)
* [How to submit changes](#how-to-submit-changes)

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](https://github.com/BetaNYC/What-is-BetaNYC/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to safespace@beta.nyc.

## What we're working on

We are working on collecting ideas and proposals for the 2018 edition of the People's Roadmap. We are also working on refining the process and tooling by which community sourced ideas are turned into formal actionable proposals.

## How to submit changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!
 
1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
2. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes...
3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.
