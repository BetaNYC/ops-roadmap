# The People's Roadmap 2018

NYC’s civic technology and open data community co-authored [The People’s Roadmap to a Digital New York City](http://nycroadmap.us/) in 2013. It is a citizen-created policy document that embodies our shared values and provided a comprehensive vision for our city and provides short-term recommendations to guide the use of technology by government. Fourteen of the 34 proposals have been introduced as legislation in City Council, nine have became laws, and nine have gone on to become public-private partnerships or applications.

Four years later, we are now in the process of updating this document. This is an open repo / task list to manage BetaNYC’s work on the updated People’s Roadmap to a Digital New York City.

## Objective / Mission

- Use insights into the current digital state/challenges of NYC civic tech and open data community to inform the 2018 digital roadmap.
- Understand the impact of civic technology on citizen’s lives, identifying key findings and insights.
- Define concepts and proposals on the future state of civic technology in NYC.
- Build a progressive New York City where technology fuels opportunity, inclusion, engagement, efficiency, and innovation.

## Approach

The overall approach includes:

- Two rounds of community engagement
    + First Round: Ideation
    + Second Round: Feedback and voting
- An online open voting platform
- An online open community written document

This project is being facilitated by a team of volunteers lead by BetaNYC, a civic-tech community organization in New York City. For more information on BetaNYC’s mission, programs, and events, please visit our website (http://www.beta.nyc).

## Impact

Since its inception, the 2013 People’s Roadmap has had 14 of these proposals drafted into legislation, 9 were signed into law, and another 9 became public-private partnerships.
