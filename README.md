# ops-roadmap

NYC’s civic technology and open data community co-authored [The People’s Roadmap to a Digital New York City](http://nycroadmap.us/) in 2013. This document embodied our shared values and provided a comprehensive vision for our city. Fourteen of the 34 proposals have been introduced as legislation in City Council; seven have became laws; and, nine have gone on to become public-private partnerships or applications. 

Four years later, we are now in the process of updating this document. This is an open repo / task list to manage BetaNYC’s work on the updated People’s Roadmap to a Digital New York City.

## Objective / Mission

- Use insights into the current digital state/challenges of NYC civic tech and open data community to inform the 2018 digital roadmap.
- Understand the impact of civic technology on citizen’s lives, identifying key findings and insights.
- Define concepts and proposals on the future state of civic technology in NYC.

## How to use this repo
Until we start writing everything as markdown files, we are using this [repo's issues](https://github.com/BetaNYC/ops-roadmap/issues) issues section to track and monitor tasks. Please be aware that a majority of us are using waffle.io to access these tasks. This means issues/tasks will have three primary flags: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, and Dones.
