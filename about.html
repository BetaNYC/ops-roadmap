    <p>In 2013, BetaNYC coordinated community meetings and workshops that lead to the development of the existing people’s roadmap. This comprehensive visioning document was co-written by NYC’s civic design, technology, and open data community.

    For the past four years, this document has guided our advocacy. The Mayor and City Council have used this document as an outline of future services. Of the 34 proposals listed, 14 have been introduced as pending legislation; seven have been signed as laws, and nine have gone on to become public - private partnerships.

    For 2018 - 2019, we are embarking on an update. Using methodologies articulated in the vTaiwan process, we are hosting an online - offline consultation process bringing together neighbors, government officials, elected representatives, scholars, experts, business leaders, civil society organizations and YOU! 

    Our initial roadmap and the vTaiwan process has helped lawmakers and the administration implement decisions with community feedback and legitimacy. The process we are using has various touch points such as a website (WEBSITE URL HERE), in-person meetings and hacking events to assist in the process.
