    <h1>About The People's Roadmap</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to the 21st century New York, built by the people, for the people. In this neighbor created roadmap, we have outlined how to humanize technology, move beyond transparency for transparency's sake, and ensure we have government technology that works for the people, built with the people.
    <br>
    <br>
    The People’s Roadmap is a living document and guides the conversation on how technology, data, and design can best be in the service of all. The values and pillars outlined in the initial document are central to America’s democratic belief. The 2013 Roadmap outlined 34 ideas — nine have developed into public - private partnerships — 14 were drafted and introduced to City Council as proposed legislation — NINE new laws were signed by the Mayor of the City of New York.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, we ask you to submit new ideas for digital advocacy. We want to harness our ideas and pioneer a government by the people, for the people, for the 21st Century.
    <br>
    <br>
    As FDR’s four universal freedoms guided our country for the last 72 years, we see them as the bedrock for the next century. In the 21st Century, the freedoms to connect, learn, innovate, and collaborate are shared community values that cut across programs, policies, tools, and communities.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is our roadmap built for city, by the city, for the 21st Century city. Together, we will continue our fight for a more equitable New York City. Just as we have self organized and acted to build a better New York for all, we will continue to build tools and practices that improve the lives of all. This is how we continue to keep New York City as the world’s premier digital city.

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <br>
    <p>In 2013, BetaNYC coordinated community meetings and workshops that lead to the development of the existing people’s roadmap. This comprehensive visioning document was co-written by NYC’s civic design, technology, and open data community.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the past four years, this document has guided our advocacy. The Mayor and City Council have used this document as an outline of future services. Of the 34 proposals listed, 14 have been introduced as pending legislation; seven have been signed as laws, and nine have gone on to become public - private partnerships.
    <br>
    <br>
    For 2018 - 2019, we are embarking on an update. Using methodologies articulated in the vTaiwan process, we are hosting an online - offline consultation process bringing together neighbors, government officials, elected representatives, scholars, experts, business leaders, civil society organizations and YOU! 
    <br>
    <br>
    Our initial roadmap and an adapted version of the <a href="https://info.vtaiwan.tw/">vTaiwan</a> process has helped lawmakers and the administration implement decisions with community feedback and legitimacy. The process we are using has various touch points such as a website, in-person meetings and hacking events to assist in the process.

    <h1>Highlighted Accomplishments</h1>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/">The City Record Online</a> — on 7 August 2014, Mayor de Blasio signed <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/393-14/mayor-bill-de-blasio-signs-two-transparency-bills-law-public-private-partnership-to#/0">Introductory 363-A</a> which requires the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to post online the City Record within 24 hours of publishing the City Record, in a searchable and downloadable format.

    <br>
    <br>
    NYC Charter, Rules, and Administrative Code are online — on 7 August 2014, Mayor de Blasio signed Introductory 149-A, requires the Law Department to publish the City Charter, the Administrative Code, and the Rules of the City of New York online and update the compilation of laws within 30 days of any change.
    <br>
    <br>
    Updates to the City’s <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/open-data-law/">Open Data Law</a> — over the last four years, we have worked with the Mayor and the City Council to strengthen NYC’s open data law with a handful of amendments. Now, the City has a continuous open data program, standards around geocoding and geographic data, data dictionaries, a framework to audit agencies, and a unified method to archive data.
    <br>
    <br>
    Expanded Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics — through our testimony to City Council, we have demonstrated a clear need for dedicated resources to the city’s open data program. BetaNYC’s advocacy has led to increased staff lines at the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics and the creation of <a href="http://www.open-data.nyc/">NYC’s Open Data Week</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Improved Freedom of Information Law Website — advocating as part of the NYC Transparency Working Group, we’ve worked with NYC Records to centralize freedom of information law (FOIL) requests into a single <a href="https://a860-openrecords.nyc.gov/">platform</a> powered by an <a href="https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/NYCOpenRecords">open source code base</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    BetaNYC’s Civic Innovation Lab and Fellows Program & Equipping Community Boards with better tools — <a hred="https://beta.nyc/programs/civic-innovation-lab/">The NYC Civic Innovation Lab & Fellows Program</a> is empowering NYC’s Community Boards to develop digital and open data practices that are appropriate for the local constituencies they serve. The Civic Innovation Lab (CIL) and Civic Innovation Fellowship (CIF) is the first and only comprehensive program dedicated to improving community boards’ use of data and technology while training the next generation of civic leaders from CUNY. Incubated out of the Manhattan Borough President’s Office, with support from the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics & CUNY Service Corps, CIL employs three technological researchers and a small class of qualified CUNY Service Corps students, aka CIF.
