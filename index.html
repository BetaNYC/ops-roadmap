  		<h1>The People's Roadmap to a Digital New York City</h1>  
	</div>
	<p>Welcome to the 21st century New York, build by the people, for the people. In this neighbor created roadmap, we have outlined how to humanize technology, move beyond transparency for transparency's sake, and ensure we have government technology that works for the people, built with the people.

	The People’s Roadmap is a living document and guides the conversation on how technology, data, and design can best be in the service of all. The values and pillars outlined in the initial document are central to America’s democratic belief. The 2013 Roadmap outlined 34 ideas — nine have developed into public - private partnerships — 14 were drafted and introduced to City Council as proposed legislation — NINE new laws were signed by the Mayor of the City of New York.

	Now, we ask you to submit new ideas for digital advocacy. We want to harness our ideas and pioneer a government by the people, for the people, for the 21st Century.

	As FDR’s four universal freedoms guided our country for the last 72 years, we see them as the bedrock for the next century. In the 21st Century, the freedoms to connect, learn, innovate, and collaborate are shared community values that cut across programs, policies, tools, and communities.

	This is our roadmap built for city, by the city, for the 21st Century city. Together, we will continue our fight for a more equitable New York City. Just as we have self organized and acted to build a better New York for all, we will continue to build tools and practices that improve the lives of all. This is how we continue to keep New York City as the world’s premier digital city.
